      <description>After leaving my new bike at Summit Bicycles for some checking, I looked for the nearest library where I can work on my Math homework. That’s how I found Stanford Auxiliary Library.
The library was on the edge of the campus. There are a few broken furnitures and some canvas-like plastic fabric lying in the front. It seemed to me like they are painted for Halloweens but I couldn’t really tell because there isn’t really any identifiable patterns on them.</description>

      <description>When I left Shanghai for the US I was all on my own. I met new friends, got a new community, had a new life style and embraced a different culture. Everything was fresh. By the end the second year, I already see Berkeley as my second home.
Now I am back, to my real home, where my family is, where I grew up, where I spent 18 years of my life.</description>
